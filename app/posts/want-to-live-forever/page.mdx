  # Do we really want to live forever?
  ### The depressing rationalization of immortality
  </div>

  In a recent statement from Bryan Johnson, the founder of 'Dont Die', he stated that ** "I don't think there's been any time in history where Homo sapiens could say with a straight face that death may 
  not be inevitable."** This statement obviously was responded to with a lot of understandable skepticism seeing as the leap from the average age of death at 77.5 years to 
  immortality is a pretty big leap. But what if we could live forever? What if you and everyone you know would be around for another 100 years, 200 years, 500 years, forever? 
  Is that something we would want? Is that something we should want?

  If you're unaware with whom Bryan Johnson is, he is a 48 year old entrepreneur who has spent over $2 million on his body in the last year. He has a team of 30 doctors and scientists 
  who are working to reverse his age. He has a goal to be 18 years old again. He has a strict diet and exercise routine that he follows religiously. He is the epitome of the "biohacker" movement.

  At the first glance of immortality, it probably seems to many a dream come true. No more disease, cancer, saying goodbye to those we love. No more death. No more fear of
  wasting your life because you have all the time in the world (literally). Think of everlasting time with family, friends. The ability to travel the world and experience
  every single thing this planet has to offer. The ability to learn every single thing there is to learn.

  This thought of escaping death is not new to humanity. Ever since the passing of written text there has been stories of the chase for immortality. For example, the Epic
  of Gilgamesh is a story about a king who goes on a quest to find immortality after the death of his friend Enkidu. The story is over 4,000 years old and is one of the
  oldest known stories in human history. It makes sense that this story has been around for so long. Death is the one thing that we all have in common. It is the one thing
  that all of our instincts in our body try to make us escape. 
  
  Take the amygdala, the part of the brain you can blame for fear and anxiety. Now you might wonder
  why would we have that? Say your a caveman and you hear a rustling in the bushes. Your amygdala is going to kick in and make you feel fear and anxiety. Now was there a lion
  in the bushes? Maybe or maybe not, this is a defense mechanism built to prevent from an unfortunate death. This can seen in a woman labeled *SM-046*, an american woman in 1994
  who had a rare genetic disorder that caused her to lose her amygdala. This led her to completely lose her sense of fear and anxiety. Scientists studied her and put her through
  experiements to see how she would react. They had her hold snakes, spiders, walk through a haunted attraction, they also had her watch some horror movies. The emotions 
  she did experience were that of excitement, curiousity. This goes to show the instinctual draw to immortality stemming from our most basic functions in our brain.

  The human brain also fails to conceptualize the concept of infinity. Let me give you you an example, think of a arrow that stretches for infinity, when your brain conceptualizes
  the arrow, you have to pinpoint the end at some point for it to be an arrow. Like say you conceptualized the arrow 50 million miles from the start. That's still not an infinite
  arrow and its not even close to that. You couild take that 50 million mile arrow and repeat that an infinite amount of times. How does this apply to immortality? When someone
  says they want to live forever, they aren't really meaning **'forever'**. In there brain their conceptualizing living 500 more years or a million. Both of which are infintely
  smaller than actual infinite time.

  All perceptions of time aren't created equal. Think of a child running in a park with friends for an hour, now think of yourself filing your taxes for an hour. The amount of time
  is the exact same but the perception of it is far from the same. The older someone gets, the faster time is perceived. Possibly because the more of it you have experienced,
  the less value we give to it, almost as if its an inflated currency, devalued with each passing year. With this, imagine perceiving an hour when your 10,000 years old. Would time
  even be comprehensable? Would years feel like days? Would days feel like seconds? Would seconds feel like nothing?

  This is where ancient philosophers come to agree that life is meaningless without death. Personally I don't think I'd see life as meaningless in the way of 'my life has no purpose',
  but more in the way of 'my time has no value anymore'. For example, lets run a little experiment: How much time do you feel you have in a day compared to when you were 7?
  Does it feel like now you have 90% to 95% of the same day if you were 7? So if you were for example 30 with that thought, then it took 23 years to lose 5-10% of your perception
  or value of a day. That was only 23 years it took. That means that each year you are losing .2% of your value of your days. Now lets go to 10,000 years old. With that same model,
  by age 10,000, your perceived value of a single day would be negative 18.986× less than at age 7. Which is to say — your days would feel so diluted, they would barely register as 
  time at all. You’d be like a ghost floating through infinite beige.

  So am I saying that the older you are the less your life is worth? No, but I am saying the older you are, the less you're **'right now'** is worth. Is that something you
  are willing to accept if you take that deal to live forever. Also the fact that they is a finite amount of things one can do on this earth. Of course it sounds ridiculous to
  us that there isn't endless opportunities but on an infinite time scale, you could walk up and down every street on earth multiple times. You could count every grain of sand
  on every beach in existense, and you could do that multiple times. For example, say you were given a small solitary confinement room with maybe one yo-yo you could play with.
  How long would it take you to go insane in that room with just a yo-yo? 20 days? Now expand that solitary confinement room to a full size house with emenities. Maybe a year or two?
  Now expand that to an entire world with oceans, lakes, beautifull mountainpasses. 1,000 years; 10,000; 1 million? The point I'm getting at is there is a real number somewhere
  with how long you can be in one spot without feeling trapped or imprisoned and just because we won't hit that in our 80 years, doesn't mean someone immortal gets to get away 
  from that problem like we do.

  So what is the conclusion? Is immortality something we should as a species strive for? Should we be trying to escape death? Let alone the fact of how improbable it is to achieve immortality,
  I think the answer is no. Would it be nice to live a little longer? Maybe 300-500 years more? Sure. But I think humans play with fire when we try to put this concept of infinite
  time (something we can't even conceptualize) into our mortality. So to Bryan Johnson and his team of scientists, I say good luck. Just don't expect me to be there when you find the fountain of youth.
