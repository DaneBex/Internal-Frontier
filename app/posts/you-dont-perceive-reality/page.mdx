  # You Don't Perceive Reality the Way You Think You Do
  ### A dive into humans lack of perception of reality
  </div>

  In 1895 while working with a cathode-ray tube in his laboratory, Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen observed a new type of light that was invisible to the human eye. 
  He called this new light "X-rays" and published his findings in a paper titled "On a New Kind of Rays".
  Along with the discovery of X-rays, shortly after came the discovery of gamma rays, also invisible to the human eye.

  After these discoveries, Arthur Eddington, a British astrophysicist, stated that *"the universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine"*.
  Pondering the thought of this unknown that we cannot see can easily lead to the question of "what else is out there that we cannot see?"
  What if there are other forms of light that we cannot see? What if there are other dimensions that we cannot see? What if there are other realities that we cannot see?
  This might seem like a stretch to some but in reality, we are only scratching the surface of what we know about the universe. Only about a century ago, we realized there are other galaxies beyond our own.

  Digging deeper leads to the question of "what is reality?" and "how do we know what is real?". Some could say that reality is what we can see, feel, touch, taste.
  But is that our reality or just our perception of reality? If we are going by only what we perceive than reality is purely only what you are seeing 'right now'.
  People you aren't around right now are not a part of reality. Think of your neighbor who always mows his lawn at 5 in the morning. Since you are not with or perceiving him
  right now, he is not a part of your reality. 
  
  This is a form of the view of **Phenomenalism**, which states that objects only exist as perceptions in the mind.
  This view is often associated with the philosopher George Berkeley, who argued that physical objects do not exist independently of our perception of them.
  The issue with this view is that it leads to the conclusion that reality is subjective and that there is no objective reality. For example, say you have a pet dog.
  You see your dog and you know that it is there. But what if you were to close your eyes and not perceive your dog? Does that mean your dog is not a part of reality anymore?
  Well this is the claim you would have to make if you object to the idea of our lack of perception of reality.

  You either have to accept the claim that reality far too complex for us to understand or you have to accept the claim that reality is subjective and that there is no objective reality.
  This is a hard pill to swallow for most people. Most people want to believe that there is an objective reality and that we can understand it through science and religion.
  While science slowly does expand our understanding of reality, humans are still limited by our perception of reality. Think of the brain as a filter. There are animals, like snakes,
  with the capability to see infrared light and use it as a way to hunt prey. These perceptions of light are a piece of reality that we cannot see due to our brains filter
  of five senses. The snakes brain (filter) is able to perceive pieces of reality that we cannot.

  Another piece of evidence for this belief of our brains filtering reality is the drug psilocyben. People who take psilocyben often report seeing things that are 'other worldly'
  or supernatural. With this being reported by many people, one would think, wow the brain must explode in activity when taking this drug. But in reality, its the opposite.
  After taking brain scans of individuals on psilocyben, scientists found that the brain activity actually decreased. The same parts of the brain that turn off when the individual dies.

  Now, am I saying you should sell all your possessions to get your hands on some mushrooms and live in the forest and talk to the tree people? No. I am not 
  claiming that psilocyben is the key to unlocking the universe or that it is a way to see reality. I am simply stating that it is a piece of evidence that supports the idea that
  our brain is not helping us perceive more of reality, but rather filtering out the reality that we are not able to see.

  I am also not claiming to say that there is no objective reality or no religious entity who created reality. But it does call into question why a creator would create a reality
  that is so complex and out of our perception if this creator did create the universe solely for us humans to perceive. This idea that the universe was created only for us humans
  is popular in the major religions of the world (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc.).

  Maybe we were not meant to perceive reality. Maybe reality is something we are allowed to only glimpse at. Maybe reality is too unfathomable for us to understand.
  Maybe we aren't supposed to understand our place in this universe. But maybe that isn't a bad thing.
