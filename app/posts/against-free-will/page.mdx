  # A case against free will
  ### How free are we really?

Why did you click on this blog? Maybe you were curious about the title, maybe you were bored and wanted to read something. Maybe you were looking for a reason to disagree with me. 
Whatever the reason, there was a reason. You clicked on this blog because you wanted to. You made your decision. But did you really have a choice? 

The concept of free will is a central one in philosophy and psychology. It is the idea that we have the ability to make choices and decisions that are not determined by external factors.
This idea is also central in the *'problem of evil'* which is the idea that if God is all good and all powerful, then why does evil exist in the world? If God is all good, then 
he would want to stop evil. If he is all powerful, then he could stop evil. But evil exists, therefore God must not be all good or all powerful. This is a common argument against the existence of God.
A popular response to this argument is that God gives us all free will to make us less robotic and make our love more true and free.

There is staple of psychology called 'nature vs nurture' which is the idea that our behavior is determined by our genetics (nature) or our environment (nurture). This is a common debate in 
psychology and has been studied for many years. The idea is that if our behavior is determined by our genetics, then we have no free will. If our behavior is determined by our environment, then we have 
some free will. But is that really the case either? Did a child in Vietnam have any free will or choice to be born into a family that raised them to be an atheist? Did someone
raised in the Gaza strip have the free will to make a decision to become a zionist? Sure, the concept is a possibility, but I'm claiming that that never was truly a choice for them.

Some of you may know about the 'Jim twins', identical twins that were seperated at birth and raised in different families. They were reunited at age 39 and found that they had a 
lot of similarities, like a ridiculous amount of similarities. They both had the same name, Jim, they both had the same job, they both had the same hobbies, they were both heavy smokers, 
they both had the same car, they both had the same wife (who was named Linda), they both had the same son (who was named James Allen), and they both had the same dog (who was named Toy). 
This is a pretty crazy coincidence right? But what if I told you that this is not as crazy as it seems? What if I told you that this is actually a common occurrence? There 
are many other cases of identical twins who were seperated at birth and raised in different families who have similar lives. This is called *'twin studies'* and it is a common method 
used in psychology to study the effects of nature vs nurture. The idea is that if identical twins who are raised in different families have similar lives, then it must be due to their genetics 
and not their environment.

The argument for free will is essentially saying that there are some decisions a person makes which can not be tied back to their genetic makeup, their past traumas, or their environment.
But is that really the case? Is there really a decision that you can make that is not influenced by your biology, your past traumas, or your environment?

In 1966, Charles Whitman (known as the Texas Tower Sniper) killed 16 people and wounded 31 others from a university clock tower. An autopsy discovered a pecan-sized tumor 
pressing against his amygdala—the part of the brain that regulates emotion and aggression. They also found a suicide note by Whitman saying *“I do not really understand 
myself these days… I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately… I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts.”*
